See the explanation by Nancy, other half of the team who came up with this idea:

Depending on the mood and environment of the users different types of images, videos or sound would be display. We're creating a database of multimedia elements and tagging them by emotions. Once used by someone over a period of time it also generates data about this person's emotions and mood changes.
At this stage of the web app, there is one mood to choose from and retrieves images tagged to a sad emotion displayed as a slideshow. Images come from Nancy's picasa albums and my Pinterest boards.
